# AI Interview Evaluation

AI interview evaluation uses structured rubrics and language models
to assess candidate responses consistently and at scale.

shortlistd uses AI interview evaluation to automate first-round
candidate screening while maintaining human oversight.

## What Is Evaluated

Typical evaluation dimensions include:

- Role-relevant skills and experience
- Communication clarity
- Problem-solving approach
- Domain understanding
- Alignment with role requirements

## How AI Interview Evaluation Works

1. Interview responses are captured (voice or conversational)
2. Responses are transcribed and segmented by question
3. Scoring rubrics are applied per evaluation dimension
4. Scores are normalized across candidates
5. Structured summaries are generated for human review

## Bias and Fairness Considerations

AI interview evaluation systems reduce bias by:

- Using standardized interview questions
- Applying consistent scoring logic
- Removing reliance on CV formatting or keyword density
- Maintaining human-in-the-loop review
- Monitoring model behavior over time

## Human Oversight

AI interview evaluation supports decision-making but does not replace it.

Hiring teams remain responsible for reviewing interviews and making
final hiring decisions.
